# FEUP TVVS 2022/23

This repository includes the projects my group developed, some materials to
study for the exams, and the theoretical classes' slides.

## Project

The project is a simple time scheduling application in Java that my group
had to test. The tests developed used various techniques and are described
in the [assignments directory](./assignments/).

You can find out more about jTimeSched (the application) on its
[README file](./README-jTimeSched.md).
