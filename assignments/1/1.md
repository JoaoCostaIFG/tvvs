## Project description

The project is a time tracking tool that allows users to track their daily tasks
and the time invested in each of them. With this app, users obtain a record of
their activities and work time.

### Project structure

- The project is organized in 4 packages;
- The main function resides in the `JTimeSchedApp.java` file (in the root package);
- Most of the code logic resides in the `Project` class (in the project package).

## Static testing

Static testing is one of the testing techniques for checking faults in software.
The main advantage of static code analysis is the fact that it is performed without
executing the code, thus being more lightweight than other types of testing. For
this reason, it is usually employed before executing the rest of the software's
test suite.

Static test tools are able to detect faults prior to the execution of other tests,
and warm about _suspicious_ aspects of the code. Another aspect that these tools
help with is code maintainability/design by allowing to enforce a certain code style.
